# Rust Undead

**Master Solana Through Gameplay**

## **About**

Rust Undead is a gamified learning platform that teaches Solana blockchain development through interactive 2D gameplay. Players create undead warriors, battle through educational Story Mode chapters, and compete in PvP—mastering blockchain concepts without reading documentation.

Dubbed the "Duolingo of Solana," Rust Undead transforms the traditional learning experience by making education feel like the game you can't put down.
